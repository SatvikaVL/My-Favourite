    <h1>I have also written book reviews for some other books that I have read</h1>
    <h2>Here are some</h2>
    <section>
      <h1>The Swiss Family Robinson</h1>
      <p>This book is about a family who were shipwrecked on remote island. The characters are The father, mother and their children Fritz, Ernest, Jack and Franz. In the book, the family goes on numerous adventures. They ventured into camping, building, hunting, farming etc for their survival in the wild with limited natural resources. I also have a favourite scene in this book. It's when the family builds a flight of stairs to reach their treehouse. It was impossible for them to fashion the stairs outside but making it within the trunk was comparatively easy for them. But only after clearing the former inhabitants which were bees.

The author behind this amazing story is Johann David Wyss. The Swiss Family Robinson was the only book that he wrote. This is actually the story told by the authorto his 4 sons,published by his elder son in 1812. At that time, it was the best book of adventure in rich literature. Alongside an amazing book, the author also gave a clear message "Nothing is Impossible". This book was definitely amazing and held my interest. I recommend this book to people who like realistic - fiction, especially nature - lovers.</p>

      <h1>The Land of Stories: The Wishing Spell</h1>
      <p>This book is about twins, Alex and Conner Bailey. Recently after their father died they came across their grandmother's fairy tale book which happened to glow and sucked everything they dropped on it into itself. Soon after, Alex had accidentally fell into book and Conner follows her. When they regain consciousness from their fall, they found out that they were trapped inside a fairy tale world. The whole book is about finding the ingredients of a spell that will teleport them back to their world. Just like any book I've read, I have a favourite scene from it. It takes place in Rapunzel's Tower, Alex had spotted Rapunzel's Tower after they escaped from a wolf pack and she was adamant that she had to climb it. She was very scared to scale the treacherous Tower but did it, just to find Connor sitting inside. Conner had read the journal they had been provided with and saw that a flight of stairs had been installed in the tower. In the tower they figured out most of the items they needed for the spell and found the first item.
The author of this fantastic book is Chris Colfer. He is a Golden Globe - winning actor known for his role as Kurt Hummel on Glee. This book is his very first book. He has produced 5 sequels and 3 prequels for the Land of stories. In the very first of the book, Chris Colfer has also mentioned that fairy tales are stories that teach us many morals and are not just stories, one of the examples being cinderella and how she stayed happy in the worst of times. This book has turned simple fairy tales to something amazing by showing everything from the mind of a normal person and how it could've been real. This book is probably good for most people but I recommend it to especially for people who like fantasy.</p>
